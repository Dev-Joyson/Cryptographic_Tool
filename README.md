# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool with Tkinter GUI

## Description
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique. The tool allows you to easily input plaintext or ciphertext, apply the cipher, and view the results instantly.

## Features
- **Encrypt**: Encrypts plaintext using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- **Decrypt**: Decrypts ciphertext back to the original text.
- **Reset**: Clears all input and output fields, providing a fresh start.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The tool uses Tkinter, Python's standard GUI library, for easy interaction.

## Requirements
To run this tool, ensure that you have **Python** and **Tkinter** installed on your system.

### Python:
Python is required to run the script. You can download and install Python from the official website:
- [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Tkinter:
Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for Python. It is typically included in Python installations. If you donâ€™t have Tkinter, you can install it using the following commands based on your operating system:

#### For Windows:
Tkinter is usually bundled with Python by default. If you don't have it, ensure that you've installed Python with the Tkinter library included.

#### For macOS:
Tkinter is also included with Python on macOS. If it's missing, you can install Python using Homebrew, which will include Tkinter:
```bash
brew install python
